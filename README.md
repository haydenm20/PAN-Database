# PAN-Database

This project is meant to create a database using a SQL server for a company with specific guidelines and requirements.
A java file is used to collect user input and utilize the database. It tracks various donors, volunteers, employee information, 
clientele, and many other variables and associations within the company. 

The report, found in the repository, gives greater detail of the exact requirements for the database. 
It also shows example user response and how the information affects the tables in the database.
